# Introduction


## Concept

The goal of adoptrValidation is to provide a comprehensive suit of test
for the [adoptr](https://github.com/kkmann/adoptr) package.
The package is not directly inteded to be used but to automatically
deploy a weekly validation report via github pages to
[https://kkmann.github.io/adoptrValidation/](https://kkmann.github.io/adoptrValidation/).
The report is implemented as a set of vignettes which are compiled
into a static web page using pkgdown.
For details on the class of supported designs, see 
https://github.com/kkmann/adoptr.


## Local validation

## Brief Introdcution to Two-Stage Designs

In `adoptrValidation` a suitable set of cases is tested in order to
validate the performance of the package `adoptr`.
This package allows to compute optimal designs (adaptive two-stage,
group-sequential two-stage and one-stage) for normally distributed data.
For a treatment group $T$ and a control group $C$ where 
the observations $X_i^T \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu_T, \sigma^2)$,
$X_i^C \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu_C, \sigma^2)$ the following hypotheses are
tested:
$$
\mathcal{H}_0: \delta := \mu_T - \mu_C \leq 0 \text{ v.s. }
\mathcal{H_1}: \delta > 0. 
$$
The power of a test procedure is computed on an alternative effect size
$\delta_1 > 0$ where a prior distribution 
$\delta_1 \sim \pi(\vartheta, \tau^2)$ is imaginable.

The trial evaluation happens as follows.
After $n_1$ patients (per group) finished the trial an interim analysis
is conducted. The interim test statistic $Z_1$ for a standard z-test is computed
and the trial is stopped early for futility, if $Z_1 < c_f$.
If $Z_1 > c_e$ the null hypothesis is rejected and the trial is stopped early
for efficacy. Otherwise, i.e. if $c_f \leq Z_1 \leq c_e$, the trial enters
in the second stage. Due to the adaptivness of the trial design, the 
stage-two sample size is a function of $Z_1$, i.e. $n_2(Z_1)$. 
Also the final rejection boundary $c_2$ depends on $Z_1$. 
At the final analysis the stage-two test statistic $Z_2$ is computed and
the null hypothesis is rejected if $Z_2 > c_2(Z_1)$. 


A design $D$ is a five-tuple consisting of the first-stage sample size
$n_1$, early stopping boundaries $c_f$ (futility) and $c_e$ (efficacy)
and stage-two functions $n_2(\cdot)$ (sample size) and $c_2(\cdot)$
(rejection boundary).
All these elements can be computed optimally in `adoptr`. 
The incorporation of continuous priors is possible as well as including
conditional and unconditional constraints. 


Given a design $D$ and a objective function $f$
the default setting in [adoptr] is the following.

$\min$ | $f(D)$ 
--- | ---
such that | Type One Error Rate $\leq \alpha$ 
and | Power $\geq 1 - \beta$ 


Often in clinical practice one is not willing to enter in a second
stage when the conditional power (i.e., the probability to reject at
the final analysis given the first-stage results) is too low or too high
because in these cases the stage-two result is likely predictable.
Therefore, introducing conditional power constraints of the form
$$
1 - \beta_2 \leq \text{Conditional Power}(z_1, D) \leq 1 - \beta_3
$$
may be desirable and are supported by `adoptr`.


In `adoptrValidation` different scenarios are investigated. 
Each scenario is determined by the assumed effect size $\delta_1$ and its
prior distribution $\pi$. 
In each scenario, different tests are performed. 
All tests are indicated by a bullet point. 





## Validation strategy 

**adoptrValidation** essentially extends the test suit of **adoptr** to cover
more different scenarios.
In order to generate a proper validation report the test Variants are not managed
using a unit testing framework like testthat but are directly included in a
set of vignettes (one per sceanrio).
These vignettes are automatically built and published (here) once per week 
using pkgdown to keep the validation report up to date with the latest 
CRAN release [TODO: we currently use our master!].
The overall failure/pass status of the latest build can be checked using the
Travis-CI badge.
In the following, all Scenarios and their respective sub-Variants are outlined.
**Scenarios** are defined by the joint distribution of the test statistic and the 
location parameter, while **Variants** are given by the respective optimization
problem (objective, constraints).


### Technical Setup

Initially, the both packages are loaded and the seed for simulation is set.
Additionally, the options for optimization are modified by increasing
the maximum number of evaluations to ensure convergence.

```{r setup}
library(adoptr)
library(tidyverse)

# load custom functions in folder subfolder '/R'
for (nm in list.files("R", pattern = "\\.[RrSsQq]$"))
   source(file.path("R", nm))

# define seed value
seed <- 42

# define custom tolerance and iteration limit for nloptr
opts = list(
    algorithm = "NLOPT_LN_COBYLA",
    xtol_rel  = 1e-5,
    maxeval   = 50000
)
```


### [Scenario I](https://kkmann.github.io/adoptrValidation/articles/scenario-I.html#tocnav)

This is the default scenario. 

* **Data distribution:** Two-armed trial with normally distributed test statistic
* **Prior:** $\delta\sim\delta_{0.4}$
* **Null hypothesis:** $\mathcal{H}_0:\delta \leq 0$

    3. Three variants: two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage. 
* **Formal tests:**
    1. All three **adoptr** variants (two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage) 
        comply with constraints. Internally validated by testing vs. simulated 
        values of the power curve at respective points.
    2. $ESS$ of optimal two-stage design is lower than $ESS$ of optimal
        group-sequential one and that is in turn lower than the one of the
        optimal one-stage design.
    3. $ESS$ of optimal group-sequential design is lower than $ESS$ of 
        externally computed group-sequential design using the [rpact](https://rpact.org/) package.

        obtained by using numerical integration via `adoptr::evaluate`?

        computed group-sequential design using the [rpact](https://rpact.org/) package.

* **Formal tests:**
    1. Check $Power$ and $TOER$ constraints with simulation.
        Check $CP$ constraint on three different values of $x_1$ in 
        $(c_1^f, c_1^e)$
    2. Are the $CP$ values at the three test-pivots obtained from simulation the 
        same as the ones obtained by using numerical integration via 
        `adoptr::evaluate`?
    3. Is $ESS$ of optimal two-stage design with $CP$ constraint higher than 
        $ESS$ of optimal two-stage design without this constraint?
