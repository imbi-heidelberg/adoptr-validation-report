The package is not directly inteded to be used but to automatically deploy a weekly validation report via github pages to https://kkmann.github.io/adoptrValidation/. The report is implemented as a set of vignettes which are compiled into a static web page using pkgdown. For details on the class of supported designs, see https://github.com/kkmann/adoptr. 1.2 Local validation … 1.3 Brief Introdcution to Two-Stage Designs In adoptrValidation a suitable set of cases is tested in order to validate the performance of the package adoptr. This package allows to compute optimal designs (adaptive two-stage, group-sequential two-stage and one-stage) for normally distributed data. For a treatment group \\(T\\) and a control group \\(C\\) where the observations \\(X_i^T \\sim \\mathcal{N} (\\mu_T, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(X_i^C \\sim \\mathcal{N} (\\mu_C, \\sigma^2)\\) the following hypotheses are tested: \\[ \\mathcal{H}_0: \\delta := \\mu_T - \\mu_C \\leq 0 \\text{ v.s. } \\mathcal{H_1}: \\delta &gt; 0. \\] The power of a test procedure is computed on an alternative effect size \\(\\delta_1 &gt; 0\\) where a prior distribution \\(\\delta_1 \\sim \\pi(\\vartheta, \\tau^2)\\) is imaginable. The trial evaluation happens as follows. After \\(n_1\\) patients (per group) finished the trial an interim analysis is conducted. The interim test statistic \\(Z_1\\) for a standard z-test is computed and the trial is stopped early for futility, if \\(Z_1 &lt; c_f\\). If \\(Z_1 &gt; c_e\\) the null hypothesis is rejected and the trial is stopped early for efficacy. Otherwise, i.e. if \\(c_f \\leq Z_1 \\leq c_e\\), the trial enters in the second stage. Due to the adaptivness of the trial design, the stage-two sample size is a function of \\(Z_1\\), i.e. \\(n_2(Z_1)\\). Also the final rejection boundary \\(c_2\\) depends on \\(Z_1\\). At the final analysis the stage-two test statistic \\(Z_2\\) is computed and the null hypothesis is rejected if \\(Z_2 &gt; c_2(Z_1)\\). A design \\(D\\) is a five-tuple consisting of the first-stage sample size \\(n_1\\), early stopping boundaries \\(c_f\\) (futility) and \\(c_e\\) (efficacy) and stage-two functions \\(n_2(\\cdot)\\) (sample size) and \\(c_2(\\cdot)\\) (rejection boundary). All these elements can be computed optimally in adoptr. The incorporation of continuous priors is possible as well as including conditional and unconditional constraints. Given a design \\(D\\) and a objective function \\(f\\) the default setting in [adoptr] is the following. \\(\\min\\) \\(f(D)\\) such that Type One Error Rate \\(\\leq \\alpha\\) and Power \\(\\geq 1 - \\beta\\) Often in clinical practice one is not willing to enter in a second stage when the conditional power (i.e., the probability to reject at the final analysis given the first-stage results) is too low or too high because in these cases the stage-two result is likely predictable. Therefore, introducing conditional power constraints of the form \\[ 1 - \\beta_2 \\leq \\text{Conditional Power}(z_1, D) \\leq 1 - \\beta_3 \\] may be desirable and are supported by adoptr. In adoptrValidation different scenarios are investigated. Each scenario is determined by the assumed effect size \\(\\delta_1\\) and its prior distribution \\(\\pi\\). In each scenario, different tests are performed. All tests are indicated by a bullet point. 1.4 Validation strategy adoptrValidation essentially extends the test suit of adoptr to cover more different scenarios. In order to generate a proper validation report the test Variants are not managed using a unit testing framework like testthat but are directly included in a set of vignettes (one per sceanrio). These vignettes are automatically built and published (here) once per week using pkgdown to keep the validation report up to date with the latest CRAN release [TODO: we currently use our master!]. The overall failure/pass status of the latest build can be checked using the Travis-CI badge. In the following, all Scenarios and their respective sub-Variants are outlined. Scenarios are defined by the joint distribution of the test statistic and the location parameter, while Variants are given by the respective optimization problem (objective, constraints). 1.4.1 Technical Setup Initially, the both packages are loaded and the seed for simulation is set. Additionally, the options for optimization are modified by increasing the maximum number of evaluations to ensure convergence. library(adoptr) library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.1.0 ✔ purrr 0.3.2 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.1 ✔ dplyr 0.8.0.1 ## ✔ tidyr 0.8.3.9000 ✔ stringr 1.3.1 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.3.0 ## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ✖ dplyr::n() masks adoptr::n() # load custom functions in folder subfolder &#39;/R&#39; for (nm in list.files(&quot;R&quot;, pattern = &quot;\\\\.[RrSsQq]$&quot;)) source(file.path(&quot;R&quot;, nm)) # define seed value seed &lt;- 42 # define custom tolerance and iteration limit for nloptr opts = list( algorithm = &quot;NLOPT_LN_COBYLA&quot;, xtol_rel = 1e-5, maxeval = 50000 ) 1.4.2 Scenario I This is the default scenario.

Check \\(CP\\) constraint on three different values of \\(x_1\\) in \\((c_1^f, c_1^e)\\) Are the \\(CP\\) values at the three test-pivots obtained from simulation the same as the ones obtained by using numerical integration via adoptr::evaluate? Is \\(ESS\\) of optimal two-stage design with \\(CP\\) constraint higher than \\(ESS\\) of optimal two-stage design without this constraint? 1.4.3 Scenario II Similar in scope to Scenario I, but with a continuous Gaussian prior on \\(\\delta\\). Data distribution: Two-armed trial with normally distributed test statistic Prior: \\(\\delta\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0.4, .3)\\) Null hypothesis: \\(\\mathcal{H}_0:\\delta \\leq 0\\) 1.4.3.1 Variant II.1: Minimizing Expected Sample Size Objective: \\(ESS := \\boldsymbol{E}\\big[n(X_1)\\big]\\) Constraints: \\(Power := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta&gt; 0.0\\big] \\geq 0.8\\) \\(TOER := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta=0.0\\big] \\leq 0.025\\) Three variants: two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage. Formal tests: All designs comply with type one error rate constraints (tested via simulation). \\(ESS\\) of optimal two-stage design is lower than \\(ESS\\) of optimal group-sequential one and that is in turn lower than the one of the optimal one-stage design. 1.4.3.2 Variant II.2: Minimizing Expected Sample Size under the Null hypothesis Objective: \\(ESS := \\boldsymbol{E}\\big[n(X_1)\\,|\\,\\color{red}{\\delta\\leq 0}\\big]\\) Constraints: \\(Power := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta&gt; 0.0\\big] \\geq 0.8\\) \\(TOER := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta=0.0\\big] \\leq 0.025\\) Formal tests: Does the design comply with \\(TOER\\) constraint (via simulation)?

I.e., for \\(\\Delta_3=0\\) reduces to a point prior on \\(\\delta=0.4\\). Null hypothesis: \\(\\mathcal{H}_0:\\delta \\leq 0\\) 1.4.4.1 Variant III.1: Convergence under Prior Concentration Objective: \\(ESS := \\boldsymbol{E}\\big[n(X_1)\\big]\\) Constraints: \\(Power := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta&gt;0.0\\big] \\geq 0.8\\) \\(TOER := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta=0.0\\big] \\leq 0.025\\) Formal tests: Simulated type one error rate is compared to \\(TOER\\) constraint for each design. Number of iterations are checked agaist default maximum to ensure proper convergence. TODO: \\(ESS\\) decreases with prior variance. Additionally, the designs are compared graphically. Inspect the plot to see convergence pattern. 1.4.5 Scenario IV: Smaller effect size, larger trials. 1.4.5.1 Variant IV.1: Minimizing Expected Sample Size under the Alternative Objective: \\(ESS := \\boldsymbol{E}\\big[n(X_1)\\,|\\,\\delta=0.2\\big]\\) Constraints: \\(Power := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta=0.2\\big] \\geq 0.8\\) \\(TOER := \\boldsymbol{Pr}\\big[c_2(X_1) &lt; X_2\\,|\\,\\delta=0.0\\big] \\leq 0.025\\) Three variants: two-stage, group-sequential, one-stage.
